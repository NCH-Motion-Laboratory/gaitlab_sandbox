Scripts and programs used at the movement analysis lab at Helsinki University
Central Hospital. Warning: many of the scripts may be specific to our lab.

Some of the scripts require the BTK package. On Linux you'll need to build the package
manually. You can find the instructions e.g. in the documentation of the
[gaitutils](https://github.com/NCH-Motion-Laboratory/gaitutils) project.
